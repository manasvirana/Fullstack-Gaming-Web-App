## 🏗️ Development Process  

1. **Backend Setup**  
   - Built a REST API using **Express.js** and **PostgreSQL** to handle game data and user interactions.  

2. **Database Schema**  
   - Designed and optimized relational tables for storing destinations and their clues efficiently.  

3. **Frontend Development**  
   - Created an interactive UI using **React.js** and **Vite**, ensuring a smooth user experience.  

4. **API Integration**  
   - Connected the frontend with the backend using `fetch API` for seamless data retrieval.  

5. **Testing & Debugging**  
   - Used **Postman** for API testing and **Jest** with React Testing Library for unit tests.  

6. **Deployment**  
   - **Backend:** Hosted on **Railway** for scalability and reliability.  
   - **Frontend:** Deployed on **Render** for a smooth user experience.  
## 🧪 Testing  

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the application, the following testing strategies were implemented:  

1. **API Testing with Postman**  
   - Verified backend API endpoints by sending requests and checking responses.  
   - Tested edge cases like invalid inputs and unauthorized access.
